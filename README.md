# Finesse

A loan, mortgage, and investment calculator in one place. No ads, no sign-up, no clutter—just the numbers and charts you need, with CSV/Excel export and print when you want to keep them.

**Why it exists:** The calculator sites I used (e.g. calculator.net) worked fine but looked dated and cluttered. I wanted one place that does loan amortization, mortgage payments (with tax/insurance/HOA), and investment growth, with a cleaner UI and export/print so the results don’t disappear.

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Stack

React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Recharts. Export via CSV or Excel (exceljs).
